2. NEW FEATURES

  - ISE 14.4 software support
  - ISE 14.1 software support
  - ISE 13.4 software support
  - ISE 13.3 software support
  - ISE 13.2 software support
  - Support for Artix-7 with ISE 13.2
  - ISE 13.1 software support, Virtex-7 and Kintex-7 support
  - ISE 12.1 software support
  - Support for Virtex-6Q and Spartan-6Q with ISE 12.1
  - ISE 11.4 software support
  - Support for Automotive Spartan-6 with ISE 11.4
  - Support for Spartan-6 Low Power with ISE 11.4
  - Support for Virtex-6 Low Power and Virtex-5Q with ISE 11.3

  - Option added to use core as Phase Generator or SIN/COS Lookup Table only.
    This capability can allow users to custom build a Direct Digital
    Synthesizer (DDS) to fit individual application needs.

  - Increased Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) from 120dBs to 150dBs.

  - Option to configure DDS using system-level parameters (SFDR and Frequency
    Resolution) or hardware parameters (Phase and Output Width).

  - Option to configure phase increment and phase offset as constant,
    programmable or dynamic (for modulation).

  - SFDR range with no noise shaping increased to 150dBs for low frequency
    resolution (that is, when Phase Width &lt;= 16-bits. Note that Phase Width
    was referred to as Accumulator Width in previous versions).

  - Taylor Series Corrected can now be used for lower SFDR (that is &gt;66dBs)
    offering solutions which trade reduced Block RAM resources for increased
    XtremeDSP slices. (Previously Taylor Series Corrected could only be used
    for SFDR above 90dBs).

  - Taylor Series Corrected has been enhanced to avoid the potential SFDR
    limits described in previous datasheets (see Known Issues section for
    further details).

  - Phase width has been reduced in multi-channel DDS to give reduced
    resources whilst maintaining frequency resolution. The update from
    previous versions automatically increases frequency resolution to
    maintain the same phase width as a previous versions.

  - PHASE_OUT now optional.

  - Supports automatic core update from DDS Compiler v3.0, v2.1 and v2.0.

  Note: This core supersedes DDS Compiler v3.0. DDS Compiler version 4.0
  is not bit-accurate with respect to earlier versions. In particular,
  first order Taylor Series Correction table entries have been optimized
  to improve overall accuracy. Extended range of DDS with no noise shaping
  may reduce DATA width requirements. The update function will aim to adjust
  Frequency Resolution to maintain the phase width and associated DATA width.
  Note that this may result in the specified Frequency Resolution parameter
  changing. However, as phase width is maintained, this will not affect
  the actual resolution of frequency or phase values. Also, there have been
  changes to latency, in particular to accommodate the new dynamic phase
  increment and phase offset options. Accumulator Latency has been removed
  and is assumed to be One.

................................................................................

4. RESOLVED ISSUES

  - For integer SFDR values the Phase Angle Width may be up to 1-bit
    smaller than intended resulting in reduced SFDR by upto 6 dBs.
    - CR529605
    - AR33261

  - For some latency values multi-channel phase offset channel out by one.
    - CR457411
    - AR 30325

  - Address bus (ADDR) not registered with DATA and REG_SELECT and WE, so one
    cycle out.
    - CR529789
    - AR33263

  - SIN/COS look-up table in DDS sometimes mapped to Block ROM when Memory Type
    was specified as Distributed ROM.
    - CR529791
    - AR33264

  - Behaviour when a programmable phase increment is written through the
    register interface.
    - CR492997
    - Section added to datasheet, entitled Core Timing, to better explain
      the latency of register writes.

  - Latency reported by GUI when Latency Configuration is Auto may be inconsitent
    with that of the core.
    - CR529794

5. KNOWN ISSUES

The most recent information, including known issues, workarounds, and
resolutions for this version is provided in the IP Release Notes Guide
located at

   <A HREF="http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/xtp025.pdf">www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/xtp025.pdf</A>

The following are known issues for v4.0 of this core at time of release:

   - Increase in registers for single channel Speed optimized DDS using
     XtremeDSP slices.
       - CR529793
       - AR33265
       - For a single channel DDS configured with Maximal DSP Use,
         programmable phase increment and Speed as the Optimization
         Goal there will be a small increase in the number of registers
         used by the core. This results from a change made in version 4.0
         to improve the consistency with which the phase increment and
         offset are absorbed into the XtremeDSP slice. Previously, phase
         increment register was absorbed into the XtremeDSP slice when
         Optimization Goal was either Area and Speed, whilst phase offset
         was only absorbed when Optimization Goal was Area. When this
         happens the initial value is set to zero. In v4.0
         absorption of both phase increment and offset only occurs when
         the Optimization Goal is Area. Speed optimization can be selected
         to avoid absorption and so enable a non-zero initial value. Also,
         in v4.0 the GUI enforces an zero initial value when a register is
         absorbed. The impact of this change is considered minimal as it
         will not happen on cores that are optimized for area.

   - Number of 18k BRAMs increased from 1 to 2 for 102 &lt; SFDR &lt;= 120dBs
       - Previous versions of the DDS Compiler restricted RAM usage in
         the range 102 &lt; SFDR &lt;= 120dBs to 1 BRAM, and provided a
         warning in the datasheet to ensure that care was taken not to
         use frequencies that could result in reduced SFDR. To provide a
         more robust solution, this restriction has been removed. The new
         solution will use one extra 18k BRAM in this range of SFDR. In
         addition, fabric has been reduced through the use of an extra
         XtremeDSP slice. Should either of these enhancements are not
         appropriate, then it is recommended that version 3.0 be used.
         Alternatively, it may also be possible to use v4.0 with an SFDR
         target of 102dBs and Taylor Series Correction, as internal
         corrections are performed to a higher precision and may provide
         higher SFDR with similar frequency restrictions (that is, phase
         increments should not be chosen that just toggle the top 18-bits
         of the phase accumulator).
